Summary
The process of extracting keywords helps us identifying the importance of words in a text. This task can be also used for topic modelling. It is very useful to extract keywords for indexing the articles on the web so that people searching the keywords can get the best articles to read.

This technique is also used by various search engines. It is obvious that they donâ€™t use any library but the process remains the same to extract keywords
